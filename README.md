### Introduction

Welcome to the **Olympics SQL Analysis Project**! This repository contains a series of SQL analyses on Olympic Games data, executed in a Jupyter Notebook for ease of interactivity. The notebook is connected to a PostgreSQL database using an SQL extension, allowing for efficient data manipulation and exploration.

This project explores various aspects of the Olympics, including:
- Identifying the most represented sports by counting unique athlete occurrences.
- Analyzing the relationship between athletes and events across different sports.
- Examining demographic details such as the oldest athletes by region.

I utilized advanced SQL techniques like JOINs, UNIONs, and CASE statements to generate insights and detailed reports. For example, I identified the most decorated athletes by filtering data to include only those with at least three gold medals. The analysis covers both summer and winter events, providing a comprehensive view of the data.

Each SQL query is carefully documented within the notebook, making it easy to follow along and understand the processes involved. This project serves as an educational resource for learning SQL in a real-world context, with practical applications demonstrated through the Olympic data.

Feel free to explore the notebook and use it as a guide to enhance your SQL skills or gain insights into the world of Olympic sports data.
